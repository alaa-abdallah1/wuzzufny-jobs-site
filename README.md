## Website Features
Our website offers several features to enhance your browsing experience:

### Dark and Light Modes
We understand that different users have different preferences when it comes to color schemes. That's why we offer both dark and light modes, which you can toggle between by clicking on the button located in the top right corner of the screen.

Our dark and light modes are designed to be visually appealing and easy to read. Whether you prefer a darker or lighter color scheme, you can enjoy a comfortable browsing experience on our website.

### Color Controller
In addition to our dark and light modes, we also offer a color controller that allows you to customize the main colors of our website. You can access the color controller by clicking on the settings button located next to the dark and light mode toggle.

With the color controller, you can choose from a wide range of colors and create a custom color scheme that matches your personal preferences. This feature is especially useful for users who want to personalize their browsing experience and make our website feel more like their own.

We believe that these features will make our website more accessible and user-friendly for everyone. If you have any questions or feedback about these features, please don't hesitate to contact us.
